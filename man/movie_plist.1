.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmovie_plist\fP must be run by a terminal at a first time. It will ask
for a directory where your movies are. The path will be saved in a file,
so you will do this only once:
.PP
  /home/USER/.config/movie_plist/movie_plist.cfg
.PP
Then it will start searching for . desktop files. These .desktop files can
be created by grap and drop an url from imdb.com to a file manager like
Nautilus or by you with these two last lines:
.PP
URL=http://www.imdb.com/title/ttXXXXXXX/
.fi
blablabla
.PP
Put the .desktop file inside a directory where the movie is stored. Do not
put two .desktop files in the same directory. Using the example above which
uses the url for \'movie_name\':
.PP
/home/USER/Videos/movie_name year/movie_name_year.desktop
.PP
Please, name the directory where the movie and .desktop files are with
something like 'movie_name year'. It will be created a list with the
directory name. And you will make a choice based on this list.
