# movie_plist
Based on smoviecat (sf.net).

Put a .desktop file inside of the movie's directory - drag and drop the url from imdb site to the file manager.
Tell a directory to do the scan - like /home/user/Videos.
A html file will be generated and PyQt will show it.

Basic feature until now - 2016-08-16.

Using sqlite3.
If a directory has only a .desktop file there is no problem.
