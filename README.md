[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hpfn/movie_plist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hpfn/movie_plist)

Starting a new version. No QWebBrowser, no<br>
cgi. It will look like deluge-gtk.

Everything seems ready. On a Debian Stretch.

TODO list:<br> 
    - search<br>
    - update status bar from menu<br>
    - pytest!

It is really slow when getting the 'title year' <br>
from internet. So it is used the name of the <br>
directory where the movie and .desktop files <br>
are instead.
